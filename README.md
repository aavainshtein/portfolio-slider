# Nuxt Portfolio Slider

This project demonstrates the **PortfolioSlider** component — an interactive pseudo 3d slider.

## Key Features

- **Looped Slider**: infinite scrolling. Makes even small portfolio looking great.
- **Reactive Engine**: Real-time style calculations and array reshuffling upon shifting by a full position.
- **Advanced Physics**: Supports touch gestures, inertia-based movement, and click-driven acceleration.
